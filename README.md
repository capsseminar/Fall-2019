# Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy

The CAPS AI Policy and Strategy (CAPS) skills course prepares international relations students to critically evaluate AI algorithms, specifically for applications that challenge conventional modes of policy and strategic decision-making. The course focuses on providing students with a deployable toolkit for assessing the trade-offs of common AI algorithms in the fields of supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.

CAPS places strong emphasis on understanding how data and the environments in which an algorithm is applied influence the algorithm’s performance and the unexpected failure modes this can create. The course addresses how domain knowledge, from the regional or strategic fields taught at SAIS, can make critical contributions towards minimizing such failure modes and ensuring an optimal application of AI to complex problems. Upon completion of the course, students will have acquired a rigorous conceptual understanding of AI algorithms. Students will have gained the foundational skills needed to evaluate and make recommendations on the application of AI algorithms to the manifold challenges of today’s complex world.

### Skills Course Policy

CAPS is an official SAIS skills course. Participants who attend all sessions and pass the requirements obtain formal certification for the course on their Johns Hopkins academic transcripts.

For the course to appear on one’s trascript, they must attend all sessions. If a session is missed due to illness or an emergency, the CAPS team will arrange a make-up session.

### Team and Contact

CAPS is created and taught by SAIS MAs Leo Klenner, Henry Fung, Cory Combs and JJ Lee. 

The course is sponsored by Sarah Sewall, Former Undersecretary of State for Civilian Secuirty, Democracy and Human Rights (2014-2017) and Speyer Family Foundation Distinguished Scholar at the Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs.

CAPS is funded through a grant from Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures.
